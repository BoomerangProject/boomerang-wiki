# Welcome to the Boomerang Wiki

### The Boomerang Vision
As the service and marketplace economies have boomed, the majority of the wealth created has remained in the hands of the platform owners, developers, and investors. Key incentives for workers and users — tips and rewards — have been misaligned, fundamentally shaping inconsistent experiences.

That's why we're introducing Boomerang - the operating protocol for marketplaces using blockchain technology to reward users and workers with tokens based on performance and usage.

As a programmatic, ratings-based rewards and tipping protocol across all service-based industries, Boomerang will become essential infrastructure for real businesses across all service economies today — from ridesharing to coffee shops to restaurants — and become the backbone of web 3.0 and the blockchain-based businesses of tomorrow.
