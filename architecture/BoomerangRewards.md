# Overview
As discussed [in the whitepaper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf), neither customers nor workers reap the true value for their contributions to the growth of businesses they shop at and work for. Boomerang, our solution for this problem, operates on three assumptions:
1. There is a strong connection between a business's public reputation and their growth rate, such that actions that improve a business's reputation will increase its revenues.
2. It's possible to create a system that rewards customers and workers for those contributions (positive reviews, good service) that contribute to the growth of a business through improving its reputation.
3. That system of rewards can operate in a manner that is financially rewarding to customers and workers without damaging the health of the business.

As we've delved into the structure of the rewards system, we've discovered that it's the workers who benefit the most from the system. Assuming a world where Boomerang is accepted everywhere, a given Customer might still only have ten or twenty rewards from reviews on a daily basis, while an employee at a high-turnover business like a coffeeshop might serve dozens of customers and get rewards accordingly. This clearly is a good thing for workers and is in line with our part of our goal, but doesn't specifically induce customers to continue to participate. As a result, we want to structure the Boomerang rewards system in a way that provides immediate rewards for Customers and encourages them to continue to participate over time.
