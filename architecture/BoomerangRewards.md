# Overview
As discussed [in the whitepaper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf), neither customers nor workers reap the true value for their contributions to the growth of businesses they shop at and work for. Our solution is Boomerang, which attempts to address this problem by using a buiness's reputation as a proxy its growth prospects and sustainably rewards customers and workers for efforts (positive reviews, good service) that improve that reputation. 

As we've delved into the structure of the rewards system, we've discovered that it's the workers who benefit the most from the system. Assuming a world where Boomerang is accepted everywhere, a given Customer might still only have ten or twenty rewards from reviews on a daily basis, while an employee at a high-turnover business like a coffeeshop might serve dozens of customers and get rewards accordingly. This clearly is a good thing for workers and is in line with our part of our goal, but doesn't specifically induce customers to continue to participate. As a result, we want to structure the Boomerang rewards system in a way that provides immediate rewards for Customers and encourages them to continue to participate over time.
