# Boomerang Meta Transaction Layer
Boomerang, in order to provide a more familiar User Experience (UX), will utilize the concept of [Meta Transactions by Austin Thomas Griffith](https://metatx.io/).
Meta Transactions allow a third party to pay the gas costs for a user. In addition, the user can offer up an ERC-20 token reward in order to
incentivize the third party to execute a transaction on behalf of the user. This will allow a user to interact with a DApp without ever needing to know about
Ethereum or Gas.
