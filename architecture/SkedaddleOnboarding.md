# Skedaddle Onboarding / Business Integration
## Proposed Solution
1. Skedaddle creates a store of deployed identity contracts pre-loaded with some amount of Boom token (~$5-10)
2. User orders a bus, is asked to write a review
3. A pre-loaded identity contract writes the review on the user's behalf (through Skedaddle using the BoomerangSDK)
4. User is given a recovery key and prompted to join Boomerang to claim Boom reward by logging in with recovery key.
> Example Recovery Key: 'zeizod-ahe-jo-joffar-luvapi'
5. User logs into identity through Boomerang react app.
6.
