# Customer
A Customer is a user who purchases a product or service from a Business. The Customer can submit a review of their purchase experience to Boomerang at the request of that Business and receive a reward in Boom tokens in return. All non-Business users start out as Customers and may later add Worker features to their identity.

# Workers
A Worker is a user who represents a Business to the Customer when the Customer is making a purchase. If the review request of the purchase experience includes a section on the Worker's performance, the Worker can receive performance rewards based on the results of the review.

# Businesses
A Business is a user that represensts an organization selling products and/or services to one or more Customers. Businesses request reviews from and send rewards to Customers. Businesses may employ one or more Workers and may choose to include questions about the Worker in the review request, resulting in payment of performance rewards to that Worker.
