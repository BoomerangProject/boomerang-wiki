# Introduction
In the "Token Distribution" section of [the white paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf), we discuss our desire for fostering long-term health of the Boomerang ecosystem through growth and participation. To accomplish this goal, we would reserve thirty percent of the Boom tokens in a growth pool, with which we intend to reward businesses for joining and participating in Boomerang. These rewards would come in the form of incentives; for example, "a business might earn more tokens from the Growth Pool based on the transaction volume over a certain period of time." 

As we've discussed the concept in more detail, we've found a few problems: 
1. Creating a program that rewards businesses for high transaction volume opens Boomerang up to Sybil attacks.
2. Despite the flaws in the intended purpose of the growth pool, we still want a way to incentivize businesses to join Boomerang.
3. We didn't define how we'd use the seven percent of tokens we reserved for the partnerships pool.

As a result, we're going to repurpose the growth and partnership pools into a single subsidization pool, which we'll use to subsizide rewards payments and transaction costs over a predetermined period of time for businesses that partner with the Boomerang Foundation. 

# Partnerships
Anyone can become a Business user by grabbing the code for the Boomerang SDK, setting it up on a system, and using it to request reviews, manage workers, and distribute rewards, all without any relationship with the Boomerang Foundation. However, in order to foster long-term growth, we want some businesses to sign up because we think they'll be good additions to the ecosystem. We'll approach these businesses, with the goal of signing a partnership agreements that guarantee usage in exchange for the benefits of the subsidization pool.

# Handling Costs
Business will incur four categories of cost when using Boomerang:
1. **Integration**: Integrating the Boomerang SDK into the software system used by the business.
2. **Rewards Distribution**: Purchasing and storing Boom tokens to distribute to Customers as rewards for responding to review requests.
3. **Identity Creation**: Paying transaction costs to create identities for new Customers.
4. **Review Requests**: Paying transaction costs to request reviews from Customers.

While we can't do much about integration costs, we can mitigate the effect of the other three categories by offering subsidies to partners. We'll distribute these subsidies from the 3.7 billion tokens initially intended for the growth and partnership pools in amounts determined by the contract negotiation with each partner. However, broadly speaking, distributions will work as follows:
1. The Boomerang Foundation certifies that the partner has completed work on the integration.
2. The Boomerang Foundation transfers Boomerang tokens to the partner's identity. The partner will use these tokens as rewards payments to Customers and Workers.
3. The Boomerang Foundation gives the partner an API key. The API key will allow the partner to request and receive refunds for the gas costs of creating identities, distributing rewards, and requesting reviews. In case of abuse, the Boomerang Foundation will be able to the throttle requests or cut off access.
