# Overview
In the "Token Distribution" section of [the white paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf), we discuss our desire for fostering long-term health of the Boomerang ecosystem through growth and participation. To accomplish this goal, we would reserve thirty percent of the Boom tokens in a growth pool, with which we intend to reward businesses for joining and participating in Boomerang. These rewards would come in the form of incentives; for example, "a business might earn more tokens from the Growth Pool based on the transaction volume over a certain period of time." 

As we've discussed the concept in more detail, we've found a few problems: 
1. Creating a program that rewards businesses for a high transaction volume opens Boomerang up to Sybil attacks.
2. We didn't define the difference between how we'd use the tokens we reserved the growth pool and the additional seven percent of tokens we reserved for the partnerships pool.

As a result, we're going to repurpose the growth and partnership pools into a single subsidization pool, which we'll use to subsizide rewards payments and transaction costs over a predetermined period of time for businesses that partner with the Boomerang Foundation. Below is a discussion of how this pool will work and what it will mean for businesses that choose to use Boomerang.

# Partnerships
This document mentions partners and partnering a few times over its course, so to avoid any confusion we'll define those terms up front. Anyone can become a Business user by grabbing the code for the Boomerang SDK, setting it up on a system, and using it to request reviews, manage workers, and distribute rewards, all without any relationship with the Boomerang Foundation. However, in order to foster long-term growth, we want some businesses to sign up because we think they'll be good additions to the ecosystem. We'll approach these businesses, with the goal of signing a partnership agreements that guarantee usage in exchange for the benefits of the subsidization pool.

# Handling Costs
Business will incur four categories of cost when using Boomerang:
1. **Integration**: Integrating the Boomerang SDK into the software system used by the business.
2. **Rewards Distribution**: Purchasing and storing Boom tokens to distribute to Customers as rewards for responding to review requests.
3. **Identity Creation**: Paying transaction costs to create identities for new Customers.
4. **Review Requests**: Paying transaction costs to request reviews from Customers.

While we have little direct control over the cost of integration, we can mitigate the effect of the other three categories by offering subsidies to partners. We'll distribute these subsidies from the 3.7 billion tokens initially intended for the growth and partnership pools in amounts determined by the contract negotiation with each partner. However, broadly speaking, distributions will work as follows:
1. The partner completes the integration work
- the Boomerang Foundation will transfer a predetermined number of tokens to the partner's identity. The partner will use these tokens to pay for rewards payments to Customers and Workers.
- We'll give the partner an API key. The API key will allow the partner to request and receive refunds for the gas costs of creating identities, distributing rewards, and requesting reviews. The Boomerang Foundation will be able to the throttle requests or cut off the access of any partner it feels is abusing the refunds process.
