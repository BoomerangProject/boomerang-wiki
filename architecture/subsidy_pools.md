# Overview
In the "Token Distribution" section of [the white paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf), we discuss our desire for long-term growth of and participation of new businesses in the Boomerang ecosystem. To accomplish this goal, we would reserve thirty percdent of the Boom tokens in a growth pool, with which we intend to reward businesses for joining and participating in Boomerang. These rewards would come in the form of incentives; for example, "a business might earn more tokens from the Growth Pool based on the transaction volume over a certain period of time." 

As we've discussed the concept in more detail, we've found a few problems: 
1. Creating a program that rewards businesses for a high transaction volume opens Boomerang up to Sybil attacks.
2. We didn't define the difference between how we'd use the tokens we reserved the growth pool and the additional seven percent of tokens we reserved for the partnerships pool.
3. 

As a result, we're going to repurpose the growth and partnership pools into a single subsidization pool, which we'll use to subsizide rewards payments and transaction costs over a predetermined period of time for businesses that partner with the Boomerang Foundation. Below is a discussion of how this pool will work and what it will mean for businesses that choose to use Boomerang.

Boomerang incurs four categories of expenses for a business:
1. **Integration**: Integrating the Boomerang SDK into the software system used by the business.
2. **Rewards Distribution**: Purchasing and storing Boom tokens to distribute to Customers as rewards for responding to review requests.
3. **Identity Creation**: Paying transaction costs to create identities for new Customers.
4. **Review Requests**: Paying transaction costs to request reviews from Customers.

While we have little direct control over the cost of integration, we can mitigate the other three categories by putting the 3.7 billion tokens intended for the growth and partnership pools in a subsidization pool.
