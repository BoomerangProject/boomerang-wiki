#Introduction#
In the "Token Distribution" section of [the white paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf), we discuss our desire for long-term growth of and participation of new businesses in the Boomerang ecosystem. To accomplish this goal, we would reserve three billion Boom tokens in a growth pool, with which we intend to reward businesses for joining and participating in Boomerang. These rewards would come in the form of incentives; for example, "a business might earn more tokens from the Growth Pool based on the transaction volume over a certain period of time." 

As we've discussed the concept in more detail, we've found a few problems: 
1. Creating a program that rewards businesses for a high transaction volume opens us up to Sybil attacks.
2. We didn't define the difference in how we'd use the tokens reserved the growth pool and the 700 million tokens we reserved for partnerships.
3. 



As proposed, the growth pool opens Boomerang to Sybil attacks, so we're reconceptualizing it as a subsidization pool 

Businesses looking to use Boomerang will encounter four types of costs:
1. **Integration**: Integrating the Boomerang SDK into the software system used by the business.
2. **Rewards**: Purchasing and storing Boom tokens to distribute to Customers as rewards for responding to review requests.
3. **Identities**: Paying transaction costs to create identities for new Customers.
4. **Review Requests**: Paying transaction costs to request reviews from Customers.

While the Boomerang Foundation has little direct control over the cost of integration, we can mitigate the other three types of costs through subsidization. In formulating the token distribution percentages (discussed in the "Token Distribution" portion of [the white paper](https://s3.amazonaws.com/boomerang-whitepapers/boomerang_whitepaper.pdf)), we discuss reserving 37 percent of the 10 billion tokens for
