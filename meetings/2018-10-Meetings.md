# October 2018 Meeting Notes

### Team Sync-Up 10/01/2018
To summarize what Kyle, Garin, and Eric just discussed: we reviewed the proposed rating and review flow (https://www.lucidchart.com/invitations/accept/1ba58674-ea34-4e06-a0da-9d424039df6a). In addition, Kyle is now working directly with two Polish developers who are also working on Universal Login to avoid duplication of effort. The goal is to have a working prototype in place by the end of the month for the Ethereum Developer's Conference, followed by internal work to combine the prototype with Boomerang smart contracts.
